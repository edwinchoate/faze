***
**Faze** is an interactive silent game where two players take turns filling in tiles on a grid in order to make something new. It's an interactive drawing tool but with a twist!

Begin by selecting one of three game sizes: Small, Medium, or Large.

To draw, simply click on the grid cell you wish to darken... but be mindful: you can only click a limited number of times per turn! (To view how many clicks you have left, see the display below the game board.)

Each game last five rounds. At the end of each round, the entire game board will fade slightly! You can start a new game at any point by clicking the New Game button at the top, right-hand corner of the screen.

The game is meant to be played silently; don't talk to the other player about what you intend to draw! See if you can collaborate to create something new as you play off of each other's decisions. 

Feel free to experience with new ways to play the game! You can create new rules to make the game your own.

Currently **Faze** works only on desktop platforms. If you experience any technical issues on small screen sizes, try to migrate to a device with a screen at least ``1170 px`` wide. If you have any questions or ideas, don't hesitate to shoot me an email at [edwin.choate@gmail.com](mailto:edwin.choate@gmail.com).

Enjoy!
